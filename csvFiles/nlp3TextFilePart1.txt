Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data. It enables systems to automatically improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning can be classified into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, a model is trained using labeled data, while unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make sequences of decisions by rewarding or punishing actions.

Machine learning algorithms use statistical methods to identify patterns and make predictions. The most common algorithms include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. One of the key benefits of machine learning is its ability to process large amounts of data quickly. It is used in applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers. These deep networks can model complex patterns and are particularly effective in tasks like speech recognition and computer vision. Despite the advancements, machine learning models can still face challenges such as overfitting, bias, and lack of interpretability. Researchers are constantly working on improving these models.
